"#","Question","Relevant Chunk IDs","Reference Answer"
"1","What are the key challenges in large-scale solar energy utilization?","3, 7, 49","Key challenges include high cost of technology, energy storage limitations, issues with distribution, and daily/seasonal variability of the solar resource. Research at IITK addresses solar energy capture, distribution, and storage to overcome these bottlenecks."
"2","Which photovoltaic (PV) technologies are planned for implementation at IIT Kanpur’s SERE?","5, 9, 10","The SERE project will use multicrystalline silicon solar cells, amorphous silicon solar cells, and high-efficiency 2D concentrators with micromorph Ge/GaAs/GaInP technology. A mix of state-of-the-art PV technologies will be installed for research and demonstration."
"3","What strategies are proposed for energy storage in the IIT Kanpur solar power system?","12, 13, 14, 49","The project proposes using batteries, polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFC), and developing solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC). Hydrogen generation units will support fuel cell systems, and research will focus on advanced SOFCs for long-term storage solutions."
"4","How does the proposed plant integrate with the existing IIT Kanpur power grid?","15, 16","The solar plant is modular, with each 50 kW string connected to a utility transformer converting inverter output (440 V) to 11 kV for transmission to the IITK substation 3 km away, where it is stepped back down to 440 V and distributed to the campus load."
"5","What is the estimated land area required for the 500 kWp PV station and associated systems?","5, 17, 18","Approximately 10,000 m² is needed for the PV panels, plus 2,500 m² for servicing, storage, and research laboratories, totaling around 12,500 m² at the Shivli site between the lower Ganga canal and Shivli Road."
