"#","Question","Relevant Chunk IDs","Reference Answer"
"1","What are the key challenges in large-scale solar energy utilization?","3, 7, 49","Key challenges include high cost of technology, energy storage limitations, issues with distribution, and daily/seasonal variability of the solar resource. Research at IITK addresses solar energy capture, distribution, and storage to overcome these bottlenecks."
"2","Which photovoltaic (PV) technologies are planned for implementation at IIT Kanpur’s SERE?","5, 9, 10","The SERE project will use multicrystalline silicon solar cells, amorphous silicon solar cells, and high-efficiency 2D concentrators with micromorph Ge/GaAs/GaInP technology. A mix of state-of-the-art PV technologies will be installed for research and demonstration."
"3","What strategies are proposed for energy storage in the IIT Kanpur solar power system?","12, 13, 14, 49","The project proposes using batteries, polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFC), and developing solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC). Hydrogen generation units will support fuel cell systems, and research will focus on advanced SOFCs for long-term storage solutions."
"4","How does the proposed plant integrate with the existing IIT Kanpur power grid?","15, 16","The solar plant is modular, with each 50 kW string connected to a utility transformer converting inverter output (440 V) to 11 kV for transmission to the IITK substation 3 km away, where it is stepped back down to 440 V and distributed to the campus load."
"5","What is the estimated land area required for the 500 kWp PV station and associated systems?","5, 17, 18","Approximately 10,000 m² is needed for the PV panels, plus 2,500 m² for servicing, storage, and research laboratories, totaling around 12,500 m² at the Shivli site between the lower Ganga canal and Shivli Road."
"6","Briefly describe the economic analysis and expected benefits of the solar power plant.","20, 21","The plant’s value ranges from Rs. 23.85 lakh (self-consumed) to Rs. 88.49 lakh (sold to grid) per year. Benefits include carbon credits under CDM, research and educational advancement, with additional social value for grid and rural supply."
"7","How is environmental impact addressed in the IIT Kanpur project?","6, 22","Main concerns are proper disposal and recycling of batteries and PV panels. No air or water pollution is expected during operation; mechanisms for panel and storage system disposal after their lifespan (15–20 years) will be developed."
"8","What is the proposed project execution timeline and strategy?","22, 23","Phase 1 (1–3 years): install 500 kWp demonstrator, supplement campus daytime power, and begin research programs. Phase 2 (4–6 years): expand to 1 MW, improve efficiency and cost via technology testing, and set up research and development facilities."
"9","What research goals are set for PV cell development at SERE?","41, 42, 43, 44, 45","Goals include achieving 17% efficiency in multicrystalline silicon and 20% in single crystal silicon solar cells, developing polymer solar cells with 5–6% efficiency, scaling prototypes, and transferring technology to industry for further development."
"10","What are the main areas and planned deliverables in energy storage research?","49, 50, 51","Focused on developing solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), optimizing stack design, fuel generation/reforming, and advanced electrocatalysts. Deliverables include a 1 kW SOFC stack, integrated hydrogen reformers, and experimental validation of materials and system design."
